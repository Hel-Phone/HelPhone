# Security Architecture: Supply Chain Monitoring

This document covers the supply chain security index served by the prover (#600). It builds on the build-pipeline gates from #624–#627 (`scripts/security/`).

## Components

```

| File                                   | Role                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server/routes/supplyChainSecurity.ts` | Report computation, dashboard rendering, routers                                               |
| `server/middleware/metrics.ts`         | Prometheus text-format renderer, `helphone_http_requests_total` counter                        |
| `scripts/security/license_policy.js`   | Approved/denied license matrix and exceptions (single source of truth)                         |
| `security-audit.json`                  | `npm audit --json --omit=dev` snapshot written at build time (`npm run security:audit-report`) |

## Design decisions

**No shelling out on the request path.** `npm audit` makes network calls and takes seconds. If an endpoint could trigger it, anyone could use that endpoint to exhaust the prover. CVE data is therefore a build-time snapshot, and the report exposes `reportAgeSeconds` so a stale snapshot is visible. Prometheus exports it as `helphone_audit_report_age_seconds`.

**Missing data is never scored as good.** If the audit snapshot is missing or malformed, `vulnerabilities.source` is `unavailable` and `index.partial` is `true`. The composite index is then computed from the other components only. Alert on `helphone_supply_chain_index_partial == 1` in production.

**No new dependencies.** The metrics exporter is about 80 lines of built-in-only code, not `prom-client`. A supply chain endpoint should not widen the supply chain it reports on.

**Low label cardinality.** Request counters use the matched Express route template (`/api/responder-status/:address`), never the raw URL. Unmatched requests are bucketed as `unmatched`. That keeps addresses and nullifiers out of metric labels.

**Dashboard hardening.** The dashboard is static server-rendered HTML with every value HTML-escaped. It is served with `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'`, so it runs no scripts and makes no outbound fetches.

## Scoring

The composite index is a weighted mean of four 0–100 components. Grades: A ≥ 90, B ≥ 80, C ≥ 70, D ≥ 60, F below that.

| Component          | Weight | Formula                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vulnerabilities    | 0.4    | `100 − (40·critical + 15·high + 4·moderate + 1·low)`, floored at 0                                        |
| Lockfile integrity | 0.3    | `% packages with integrity hash − 5 per non-registry source − 1 per sha1-only hash`; 0 without a lockfile |
| License compliance | 0.2    | `% packages on the approved matrix`; 0 if any non-excepted GPL/AGPL dependency exists                     |
| Sustainability     | 0.1    | `100 − 1000 × (deprecated / total)`                                                                       |

If a component is `null` (currently only vulnerabilities, when no snapshot exists), its weight is redistributed across the remaining components.

Non-registry sources are listed explicitly (e.g. the JSR-hosted `@creit-tech/stellar-wallets-kit`). They are not necessarily bad, but they skip npm's registry signing, so each one should be a deliberate choice.

## Suggested alerts

```

# Content Security Policy: Dynamic Nonce Injector (#530)

`server/middleware/csp.ts` gives every HTTP response its own cryptographic nonce and a strict policy that only trusts scripts and styles carrying it.

## Flow

```
vite build ──> dist/index.html   <script nonce="__CSP_NONCE__" ...>   (html.cspNonce in vite.config.ts)
                     │
request ──> createCspMiddleware ──> res.locals.cspNonce = random 128-bit value
                     │              Content-Security-Policy: ... 'nonce-<value>' ...
                     └──> createHtmlHandler ──> injectNonce(html, <value>) ──> Cache-Control: no-store
```

The header and the markup use the same value because both come from `res.locals.cspNonce`. The handler refuses to render if the middleware did not run first, instead of serving scripts a strict policy would block.

## The policy

| Directive | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default-src` | `'none'` | Everything not listed is denied |
| `script-src` | `'self'` `'nonce-…'` `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` | No `'unsafe-inline'`. `wasm-unsafe-eval` only lets the Noir/Barretenberg WASM compile; it does not allow `eval()` |
| `style-src` | `'self'` `'nonce-…'` `fonts.googleapis.com` | Inline `<style>` needs the nonce |
| `style-src-attr` | `'unsafe-inline'` | Nonces cannot mark `style=""` attributes, which React and Mapbox set at runtime. Scoped to attributes only |
| `connect-src` | `'self'` + allowlist | Soroban RPC, Horizon, Mapbox and the API. Extend with `CSP_CONNECT_SRC` |
| `object-src` / `frame-ancestors` | `'none'` | No plugins, no framing |
| `base-uri` / `form-action` | `'self'` | Blocks base-tag and form-hijack injection |

## Configuration

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CSP_CONNECT_SRC` | Comma-separated extra `connect-src` origins. Each must be `scheme://host[:port]` with an optional leading `*.`; anything else (`*`, `https:`, entries containing `;` or `,`) is dropped with a warning, never added to the header |
| `CSP_REPORT_ONLY` | `true` sends `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` so a change can be observed before it is enforced |
| `CSP_REPORT_URI` | Path or URL browsers POST violation reports to |

`upgrade-insecure-requests` is added when `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Design decisions

**HTML with a nonce is never cacheable.** A cached page would replay an old nonce against a new header (or the reverse) and break the app, or worse, make a reused nonce guessable. The HTML route sends `Cache-Control: no-store`. Hashed static assets under `dist/` are unaffected.

**Invalid configuration fails closed.** A bad `CSP_CONNECT_SRC` entry is discarded rather than interpolated, so an environment typo cannot widen the policy or inject a header.

**The service worker precaches `index.html`.** A precached shell would serve a stale nonce. Keep the navigation route network-first for HTML when this ships; until then a service-worker-served page will be blocked by the policy rather than run unnonced scripts.

**Unchanged for API-only deploys.** The HTML route falls through when `dist/index.html` does not exist.

# End-to-End Encrypted Emergency Payloads (#E2EE)

Emergency details — the contact number and the medical notes — are sealed on the
requester's device before anything is submitted. The ledger, the relay and the
map markers only ever carry ciphertext, so a compromised backend, a hostile RPC
node, or a subpoena over the relay store yields nothing.

## What is and is not encrypted

| Field | Where it lives | Encrypted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contact` | payload | **yes** |
| `medicalNotes` | payload | **yes** |
| `nickname` | payload | **yes** |
| `allergies` (optional) | payload | **yes** |
| `lat` / `lng` | on-chain + relay | no — see below |
| `emergency_type` | on-chain + relay | no |
| request id, status, timestamps | on-chain + relay | no |

Location is deliberately left readable: dispatch requires it, and the existing
ZK location proof (`src/lib/zk.ts`) plus the client-side `anonymizeLocation()`
coarsening are what protect it. Encrypting coordinates would push the
responder-selection problem onto the responders, which is a worse trade for an
emergency service. Anyone reading the ledger learns "a request exists near here"
and nothing about who it is for.

## Envelope format

One JSON object, stored as `Bytes` on-chain (`encrypted_payload`) and relayed
verbatim. Version 1, algorithm `ECDH-P256-HKDF-SHA256+AES-256-GCM`:

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "algorithm": "ECDH-P256-HKDF-SHA256+AES-256-GCM",
  "bindingContext": "9f1c…",        // public, tamper-evident
  "ephemeralPublicKey": "04…",     // 65-byte uncompressed P-256
  "iv": "…",                        // 12 bytes, AES-GCM nonce
  "ciphertext": "…",                // sealed payload
  "authTag": "…",                   // 16 bytes
  "wrappedKeys": [                  // one entry per authorized reader
    { "keyId": "…", "wrappedKey": "…", "wrapIv": "…", "wrapAuthTag": "…" }
  ],
  "createdAt": 1728000000000
}
```

## Key schedule

- A fresh 32-byte **content key** per request, from `crypto.getRandomValues`.
  It is never transmitted; it only travels inside `wrappedKeys`.
- Per recipient: a one-shot **ephemeral P-256 key pair** is generated,
  ECDH is performed against that recipient's public key, and the shared secret
  is run through HKDF-SHA256 to a 256-bit **key-encryption key**.
- The content key is sealed to each recipient with AES-256-GCM under that KEK.
- The payload is sealed **once** under the content key, so the ciphertext body
  is identical for every recipient and the envelope grows by ~145 bytes per
  recipient rather than re-encrypting the body N times.

`extractable` is `true` only on keys that must be persisted for a reload
(the responder's long-lived key pair). The per-request ephemeral and content
keys are generated non-extractable and are discarded once the envelope is built.

## Domain separation and context binding

Every AEAD tag is computed with a distinct `info`/AAD, so no ciphertext from
one layer can ever be replayed as another:

| Layer | Bound to |
| --- | --- |
| content encryption | `bindingContext` |
| CEK wrap | `bindingContext` + recipient `keyId` |

`bindingContext` is a client-generated submission id (a UUID). It is carried in
the envelope in the clear — it is public, and the AEAD tags make editing it
fail authentication — so a responder needs no out-of-band coordination.
`decryptEmergencyPayload` accepts an optional expected context and will refuse to
open an envelope bound to a different request.

The on-chain request id is assigned by the contract and so cannot be part of a
pre-signature binding; the relay is therefore indexed by **both** the submission
id and the ledger request id.

## Responder keys

A responder generates an ECDH P-256 key pair in the browser, publishes the
public half, and keeps the private half in the tab. `keyId` is a truncated
SHA-256 of the public key, so it is stable across reloads, identical from
either half of the pair, and lets an envelope be matched to its `wrappedKeys`
entry without trusting registry ordering.

A wallet may register several keys (a laptop and a phone); the registry is keyed
by `keyId`, so each is published and each receives its own wrapped key.

Private keys are never sent to the server. The relay has no endpoint that
accepts key material, and both write paths reject any body containing a
`privateKey`/`secretKey`/`mnemonic`-shaped key before validating anything else.

## Relay

`server/routes/dispatch.ts` is a blind, opaque relay:

- validates the envelope structurally and for size, but cannot read it;
- stores envelopes keyed by submission id and by on-chain request id;
- rate-limits writes per IP;
- logs request id, recipient count and byte size only — never the blob;
- exposes Prometheus counters for writes, reads, rate-limit hits and refusals.

It is an **accelerator, not a system of record**. The authoritative copy is the
envelope in the contract's `encrypted_payload`, so a relay wipe or outage costs
latency and nothing else. This is why the in-memory store is acceptable today;
a durable store must have the same property — it must be safe to lose.

## Limits

| Limit | Value | Enforced in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plaintext payload | 4 KiB | `encryptEmergencyPayload` |
| Serialized envelope | 12 KiB | client + relay + contract `PayloadTooLarge` |
| Recipients per envelope | 32 | client + relay |

The 12 KiB envelope budget is the contract's storage bound, chosen so a full
32-responder roster still fits in one `create_request`.

## Contract change: breaking

`HelpRequest.nickname: String` and `HelpRequest.contact: String` are replaced by
`encrypted_payload: Bytes`, and `create_request` drops the phantom `priority`
argument and takes the sealed payload in its place.

> **Migration required.** A contract deployed before this change has
> `HelpRequest` entries encoded with the old field set. Reading them with the new
> contract will fail to deserialize, and there is no in-place upgrade path
> because the stored XDR layout changed. Testnet and mainnet contracts must be
> redeployed, and any deployment holding live requests must drain or archive
> them first. There is no code path that writes plaintext into the new field:
> `encodeEncryptedPayload` rejects anything that is not a valid v1 envelope.

New validation errors on the contract: `PayloadEmpty = 12`,
`PayloadTooLarge = 13`, `EmergencyTypeInvalid = 14`.

## Threat model

**Protected against**

- a curious or compromised relay/backend operator reading medical details;
- RPC node or indexer snooping on transaction contents;
- passive network observers (everything is TLS plus AEAD-sealed);
- a responder not addressed by an envelope opening it;
- replay of an envelope under a different request (`bindingContext` in the AAD);
- transplanting one recipient's wrapped key under another's `keyId`.

**Not protected against**

- a responder who *is* addressed reading the details they were dispatched for;
- a compromised browser extension or XSS in the requester's tab, which sees the
  plaintext before sealing and the private key after import;
- traffic analysis — an observer still learns that a request happened, roughly
  where, and how many responders it was sealed for;
- the requester's own device backups, since the responder key is in
  `sessionStorage` until it is moved into the encrypted `SecureStorage`.

## Design decisions

- **Hybrid, not per-recipient encryption.** One AES-GCM body with N wrapped keys
  keeps a 32-responder envelope inside the contract's storage budget; sealing
  the body N times would not.
- **ECDH P-256 + HKDF rather than RSA.** Browser-native, no key-size cliff, and
  the WebCrypto API is the same in the browser, in Node and in tests.
- **Ephemeral keys per request rather than a long-lived responder public key
  for wrapping.** A fresh ephemeral key per recipient per request means a
  compromised responder key only exposes the envelopes addressed to it, and
  there is no reusable "encrypt to responder X" oracle.
- **Blind relay, authoritative on-chain.** A relay that is down or wiped must
  never be able to lose a request, only to slow one down.
- **Location left readable.** Dispatch needs it, and the ZK proof plus
  coarsening already address the privacy risk; hiding it would push
  responder-selection onto the responders.

## Testing

`test/e2e-encryption.test.js` covers the full path: key generation and `keyId`
derivation, JWK round-trip across a simulated reload, single and multi-recipient
seal/open, non-recipient rejection, context binding, tamper resistance for the
ciphertext, tag, IV, context field and wrapped keys, algorithm/version
downgrade, envelope size and recipient limits, plaintext-leak checks on the
serialized envelope, on-chain hex encoding, and an opaque relay round trip
driven through the real Express routers.

`test/contract-functions.test.js` covers the ledger side; the Rust cases in
`contract/contracts/helphone-contract/src/test.rs` cover the storage and
validation rules.
