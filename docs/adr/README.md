# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR records one architecture decision: its context, the options considered, the evidence and the consequences. ADRs produced by time-boxed feasibility spikes link to the spike report and raw benchmark data in [`docs/spikes/`](../spikes/README.md).

| ADR | Title | Status | Spike |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ADR-004](ADR-004-offgrid-map-sync.md) | Off-Grid Incident Map Synchronization: State Vector Pruning vs OT Snapshots | Proposed | #604 |
| [ADR-005](ADR-005-zk-proof-aggregation.md) | Client-Side ZK Proof Aggregation Feasibility & Resource Allocation Limits | Proposed | #605 |
| [ADR-006](ADR-006-offline-routing.md) | Offline Client-Side Routing Algorithm & Vector Data Format Selection | Proposed | #606 |
| [ADR-007](ADR-007-offline-storage.md) | High-Throughput Offline Client Storage: IndexedDB vs OPFS SQLite WASM | Proposed | #607 |
| [ADR-014](ADR-014-binary-telemetry-protocol.md) | Binary Protocol Selection for Zero-Jank Telemetry Map Streams | Proposed | #614 |

ADR-001 to ADR-003 are not in this directory.

**Status values:** *Proposed* (evidence gathered, awaiting maintainer sign-off), *Accepted*, *Superseded by ADR-NNN*.
